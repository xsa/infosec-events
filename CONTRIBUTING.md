# CONTRIBUTING

Thank you for your interest in contributing!
This project is a community‑driven, open list of cybersecurity conferences, meetups, and CTFs. Contributions of all kinds are welcome—new events, updates, corrections, automation ideas, and more.
Please take a moment to read this guide to ensure smooth and consistent contributions.

## Ways to Contribute

You can contribute by:
* **Adding a new event** (conference, CTF, meetup, workshop)
* **Updating details** of an existing event (dates, links, locations)
* **Fixing typos** or improving clarity
* **Improving the automation**, GitHub Actions, or the project website
* **Reporting issues**, corrections, or outdated entries

No contribution is too small.

## Adding a New Event

To add a new entry, please use the existing guided template:

👉 **Open a new event request using the template**

```Issues > New Issue > New Entry Submission```

This ensures:
* A consistent event format
* Correct categorization
* Required fields (dates, location, link, etc.)
* Lower review overhead

If you prefer to submit a pull request directly, that's fine too—just make sure your entry follows the formatting conventions described below.

## Event Formatting Rules

When submitting an event (via PR), use the structure already present in the repository:
* Keep events chronologically ordered
* Ensure dates use the format: ```MMM DD, YYYY```
* Use the official event name and official links (website and social)
* Avoid marketing descriptions—keep entries factual and concise

## Before Opening a PR or Issue

Please check:
* The event is not already listed
* The link is valid and up to date
* Dates and location are confirmed from the official source
* The formatting matches the existing style

This helps keep the repository clean and avoids duplicates.

## Pull Requests

If you are submitting a pull request:
* Keep PRs focused on one logical change (e.g., a single new event)
* Follow the formatting rules above
* PR title should be clear (e.g., “Add DEF CON 2026”)
* The PR template checklist will guide you

Maintainers may request small edits for consistency.

## Community Expectations

We follow a straightforward set of norms:
* Be respectful and constructive
* Keep submissions factual and vendor‑neutral
* No spam or promotional content
* Contributions should benefit the **security community as a whole**
