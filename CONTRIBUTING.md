# CONTRIBUTING

Thank you for your interest in contributing!
This project is a community‑driven, open list of cybersecurity conferences, meetups, and CTFs. Contributions of all kinds are welcome—new events, updates, corrections, automation ideas, and more.
Please take a moment to read this guide to ensure smooth and consistent contributions.

## Ways to Contribute

You can contribute by:
* **Adding a new event** (conference, CTF, meetup, workshop)
* **Updating details** of an existing event (dates, links, locations)
* **Fixing typos** or improving clarity
* **Improving the automation**, GitHub Actions, or the project website
* **Reporting issues**, corrections, or outdated entries

No contribution is too small.

## Adding a New Event

To add a new entry, please use the existing guided template:

👉 **Open a new event request using the template**

```Issues > New Issue > New Entry Submission```

This ensures:
* A consistent event format
* Correct categorization
* Required fields (dates, location, link, etc.)
* Lower review overhead

If you prefer to submit a pull request directly, that's fine too—just make sure your entry follows the formatting conventions described below.

## Event Formatting Rules

When submitting an event (via PR), use the structure already present in the repository:
* Keep events chronologically ordered
* Ensure dates use the format: ```MMM DD, YYYY```
* Ensure the country flag emoji is used "as-is". This is to ensure that the Mastodon bot posts render them correctly.
* Use the official event name and official links (website and social)
* Avoid marketing descriptions—keep entries factual and concise

## Before Opening a PR or Issue

Please check:
* The event is not already listed
* The link is valid and up to date
* Dates and location are confirmed from the official source
* The formatting matches the existing style

This helps keep the repository clean and avoids duplicates.

## Pull Requests

If you are submitting a pull request:
* Keep PRs focused on one logical change (e.g., a single new event)
* Follow the formatting rules above
* PR title should be clear (e.g., "Add DEF CON 2026")
* The PR template checklist will guide you

Maintainers may request small edits for consistency.

## Generated files

Do not commit `static/events.ics` — it is automatically generated by CI
after each merge. PRs containing this file will be asked to remove it.

## Maintainer Tools

The following scripts are intended for maintainers and contributors only — they are not part of the CI pipeline.

### `scripts/check-recurring.py` — Gap checker

Compares `RECURRING.md` (the canonical list of all known recurring events) against `README.md` (upcoming events for the current year) and reports which events have not yet been scheduled.

Run it at the start of each year, or any time you want to check for gaps:

```bash
python3 scripts/check-recurring.py
```

Options:
* `--year YYYY` — check against a specific year instead of the current one
* `--verbose` — also list events already confirmed present

### `scripts/generate-recurring.py` — Regenerate the canonical list

Scans all `YYYY.md` files and `README.md`, deduplicates events by name, and regenerates `RECURRING.md` sorted alphabetically with `TBD` dates. Run this after a year-end archive to keep the list up to date:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate-recurring.py
```

Review the output for any duplicate entries caused by events that changed their name over the years, and clean those up manually before committing.

## Community Expectations

We follow a straightforward set of norms:
* Be respectful and constructive
* Keep submissions factual and vendor‑neutral
* No spam or promotional content
* Contributions should benefit the **security community as a whole**
