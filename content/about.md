This site mirrors the structure of the GitHub repository:

- **README.md** — current year's events (displayed as the homepage)
- **YYYY.md** — archives of previous years (available under “Archive”)

The goal is to maintain a simple, transparent, and community‑driven list of cybersecurity events, kept versioned and openly accessible.
